# Introduction
Smolies is a fun, simple text based game created fully in Python.
It was inspired by popular in the 90s pet games called Tamagotchi, where player was resposible for keeping their virtual pet happy and alive.
As Smolies is not trying to be a copy of it, it still brings the 90s nostalgia back!
